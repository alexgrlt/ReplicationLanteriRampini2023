"""
Discretization method for a AR(1) process of the form ``z_{t+1} = \mu + \rho z_{t} + u_t`` where ``u_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma)``
It must be defined as:  rouwen(N:: number nodes, μ:: mean of the process, σ:: sd of the innovation, ρ:: persistence).
N must be an integer and all other inputs are Floats. The paper considers N=2.
Returns a tuple with the discretized grid for the realizations of the shock ``Z`` (a vector of size N), and its transition matrix ``Π`` (size NxN).
