The expression of these FOC is given explicitly as in the Matlab replication files.  The inputs correspond to an array with some level of new and old capital (xx), the parameter structure defined before with the associated dictionary with functions at the core of the setup (notably the policy function with its derivatives and production function with its derivatives), a price for capital q and another parameter m. In the next function (getDSshocksfb), m is defined as the matrix of expected payoffs.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#ReplicationLanteriRampini2023.getDS_shocks_fb-Tuple{Matrix, Any, Array, Array, Number}","page":"Home","title":"ReplicationLanteriRampini2023.getDS_shocks_fb","text":"getDSshocksfb(Ps::Matrix,sgrid, kNfb,kUfb,q0)  This function uses NLsolve to solve for the FOC found with fbdynunc ans deduce the level of old capital supplied and demanded optimally by firms of a given cohort.
